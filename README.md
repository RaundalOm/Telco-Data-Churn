# Telco-Data-Churn
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning and data analytics techniques. 
Dataset
Source: Kaggle Telco Customer Churn Dataset

Size: ~7,000 rows, 21 columns

Features include:

gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents

tenure, PhoneService, InternetService, etc.

MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges

Target: Churn (Yes/No)

📌 Objectives
Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Handle missing values and outliers

Encode categorical variables

Build ML models to predict churn

Evaluate and compare model performance

Visualize insights and results

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization

Scikit-learn – Modeling

Logistic Regression
Jupyter Notebook

Final model achieved ~85% accuracy

📊 Sample Visualizations
Churn vs. Tenure

Churn by Contract Type

Feature importance from Random Forest

✅ Conclusion
Identified key drivers of churn: Contract Type, Tenure, Tech Support, Monthly Charges

Delivered a predictive model that can be integrated into a CRM to flag at-risk customers.

🚀 Future Improvements
Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit

Integrate with a dashboard (Power BI/Tableau)

Automate data updates and retraining pipeline
